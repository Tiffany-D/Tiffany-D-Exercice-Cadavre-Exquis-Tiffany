## Donald's Story

> Donald decided to go out and see his friend.

He met Mickey Mouse on way.

Mickey was well dressed and had a flower bouquet in his hands. Donald was clearly surprised since Minnie was away for work in Asia.

"Why are you all dressed up like that Mickey ? And who are those flowers for ?" asked Donald.
